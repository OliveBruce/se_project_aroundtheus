# Project 3: Around The U.S.

Around the U.S. webpage is the project for Sprint 3 at TripleTen with the Software Engineering program. It was created using HTML and CSS based on a Figma design. The idea of the website it for users to create a profile that they can use to then share photos they have taken of locations around the US. It is made to have a responsive design so that when users view the page from different size screens, it will look appealing, no matter the screen. The files are organized in a flat BEM structure. All CSS styles are separated into different files based on their HTML blocks.

### Plans for improvement

This project was actually really fun. I think it was great for our first project working from scratch. Something that could improve it would maybe be a bit more practice working with Figma before getting started on the project. Not much, but it could help to have a fairly good understanding before jumping in. Other than that, I think this project was great. I feel like I learned a lot here.

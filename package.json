  "description": "Around the U.S. webpage is the project for Sprint 3 at TripleTen with the Software Engineering program. It was created using HTML and CSS based on a Figma design. The idea of the website it for users to create a profile that they can use to then share photos they have taken of locations around the US. It is made to have a responsive design so that when users view the page from different size screens, it will look appealing, no matter the screen. The files are organized in a flat BEM structure. All CSS styles are separated into different files based on their HTML blocks.",
